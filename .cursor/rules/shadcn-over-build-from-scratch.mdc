## When to use shadcn/ui components

Always prefer shadcn/ui components over building components from scratch. shadcn/ui is not a traditional component library but a collection of reusable components that you can copy and paste into your project.

### Core principles:

1. **Check First**: Before creating any new UI component, check if shadcn/ui has a component that serves your purpose.

2. **Use the CLI**: Add components via the shadcn CLI using:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]
   ```

3. **Composition over Creation**: Compose existing shadcn components to create more complex interfaces.

4. **Styling Guidelines**:
   - Modify components via Tailwind classes
   - Keep shadcn's component structure intact
   - Use composition patterns like rendering slots and children

5. **When to customize**:
   - For styling adjustments: use Tailwind or CSS variables
   - For behavioral changes: extend through composition first
   - Only modify component source code when absolutely necessary

6. **Available Components**: Check https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components for the full component list before creating new ones.

Remember: The shadcn philosophy is "This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library."

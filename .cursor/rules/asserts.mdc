TESTING RULE: 
Each unit test should have a clear purpose and verify specific behavior. 

Write separate tests for positive cases (what should happen when inputs are valid) and negative cases (how the system handles invalid inputs or error conditions). 

Name tests descriptively to document the expected behavior. 

Focus on testing outcomes rather than implementation details, and maintain independence between tests.

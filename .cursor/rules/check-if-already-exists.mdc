## Always check documentation before implementing

Before implementing any feature or component, always check existing documentation and implementation status to avoid duplication or inconsistent approaches.

### Key documentation to check:

1. **Master Build Plan**: [master-build-plan.md](mdc:ai-docs/end-to-end-features/master-build-plan.md)
   - Contains the complete project roadmap
   - Details which stories are completed (marked with [x])
   - Provides implementation details for each story

2. **Epic-specific documentation**:
   - [Epic 0: Project Setup](mdc:ai-docs/end-to-end-features/epic-0-Project-Setup/)
   - [Epic 1: Data Model](mdc:ai-docs/end-to-end-features/epic-1-Data-Model/)
   - [Epic 2: Public Directory](mdc:ai-docs/end-to-end-features/epic-2-Public-Directory/)
   - [Epic 3: Listing Details](mdc:ai-docs/end-to-end-features/epic-3-Listing-Details/)
   - [Epic 4: Auth and Account](mdc:ai-docs/end-to-end-features/epic-4-Auth-and-Account/)
   - [Epic 5: Share and SEO](mdc:ai-docs/end-to-end-features/epic-5-Share-and-SEO/)

### Implementation process:

1. Check the Master Build Plan to determine if the feature is already implemented
2. Review the relevant epic documentation for implementation details
3. Verify code files mentioned in documentation to understand current implementation
4. Only implement new code if the feature is not already built, or needs extension
5. Follow existing patterns, styles and approaches when modifying or extending existing code

Always prefer extending existing implementations rather than creating duplicates or alternative approaches.

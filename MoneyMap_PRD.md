**üìù PRD: UK Personal Finance Knowledge Graph "MoneyMap" **

**üìå Problem Statement**

Personal finance is a fragmented topic with valuable resources scattered across books, blogs, newspaper articles, social media posts, and institutional reports. It's difficult for users to find **high-quality, relevant resources** efficiently.

This project aims to build a **comprehensive, structured database of UK personal finance resources** that will evolve into a **Knowledge Graph backend** for a public-facing chat app. The app will enable users to ask personal finance questions and receive accurate, contextual answers, with an initial focus on helping young adults build good financial habits.

**Target Audience:**
- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Personal use by the developer/researcher for collecting and analyzing resources
- **Future Phases:**
  - Young adults seeking financial education
  - Financial educators and content creators
  - General public interested in UK personal finance

**‚ö°Ô∏è tl;dr**

Create a **custom web app database** to store **personal finance resource references (URLs, books, articles, etc.)**, with **manual notes and tags** for now, evolving into an **AI-assisted Knowledge Graph** for **efficient retrieval by key financial concepts**.

**üéØ Goals**

**Business Goals**

1. Build a **centralized knowledge repository** to streamline personal finance information retrieval.

2. Lay the foundation for a **public-facing chat app** that uses the database to answer personal finance questions.

3. Deliver a **working MVP quickly** to allow for easy resource storage and tagging, and iterate over time.

**User Goals**

1. **Quickly store and retrieve relevant finance resources** by concept (e.g., "Mortgages," "Credit Score").

2. Keep **manual notes or action items** attached to each resource.

3. Build a **scalable tagging system** that evolves with user needs.

4. Eventually allow users to **explore connections between financial concepts** in an intuitive way.

**Non-Goals (for MVP)**

1. **AI-assisted tagging** (planned for future iterations).

2. **Handling complex chat queries** directly from the database (this will come once the Knowledge Graph is mature).

**üë§ User Stories**

**Phase 1: MVP (Personal Use)**

1. As a user, I want to quickly add resources (URLs, books, articles) to the database so I can keep track of them.

2. As a user, I want to check if a resource already exists to avoid duplication.

3. As a user, I want to add notes and action items to each resource to track my thoughts or next steps.

4. As a user, I want to tag resources with predefined keywords to make them easy to organize and retrieve.

**Phase 2: Knowledge Graph**

5. As a user, I want to search for resources using keywords and key concepts to find what I need faster.

6. As a user, I want to see **related resources** based on **semantic similarity** and connections between topics.

7. As a user, I want to **explore a visual knowledge graph** to discover connections between concepts.

**Phase 3: Public Chat App**

8. As a public user, I want to ask natural-language finance questions and get **resource-backed answers** from the database.

9. As a public user, I want to create an account and save my preferences for **personalized recommendations**.

10. As a public user, I want to search for resources by topic and see relevant results (e.g., "How do I build a pension fund?").

11. As a chat app user, I want to ask questions in natural language and get resource-backed answers.

**üìö User Experience (MVP Flow)**

**MVP Database Flow (Today's Goal)**

1. **Add a New Resource**

‚Ä¢ Input fields:

‚Ä¢ **URL**

‚Ä¢ **Title**

‚Ä¢ **Author**

‚Ä¢ **Type** (e.g., book, blog, article, video, etc.)

‚Ä¢ **Notes** (manual notes or action items)

‚Ä¢ **Tags** (select from a predefined list, e.g., #Mortgages, #CreditScore)

2. **View Resources**

‚Ä¢ Search by title, author, or tag.

‚Ä¢ Filter by type (e.g., "Show me all blog posts about taxes").

3. **Edit Resources**

‚Ä¢ Update notes or tags as needed.

**üîß Technical Considerations**

**Tech Stack**

‚Ä¢ **Frontend**: React or Next.js for a fast, responsive web interface.

‚Ä¢ **Backend**: Node.js/Express for handling resource storage and API integrations.

‚Ä¢ **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data handling or Firestore for a more scalable NoSQL option.

‚Ä¢ **Graph Database**: **Neo4j** for future Knowledge Graph integration.

**Tagging System**

‚Ä¢ **Manual tagging** in the MVP with a predefined list of tags.

‚Ä¢ Tags should be stored as **relations in the database** to support future AI-assisted tagging.

**Integration with Obsidian**

‚Ä¢ Export resources and notes to a local **Obsidian vault**.

‚Ä¢ Sync tags between the web app and Obsidian.

**Future Considerations**

1. **Vector Embeddings**

‚Ä¢ Use **OpenAI's embeddings API** to generate semantic vectors for resources, enabling more advanced search and retrieval.

2. **Knowledge Graph**

‚Ä¢ Store **relationships between resources, tags, and concepts** in a graph database like Neo4j.

‚Ä¢ Example: "Pension Planning" ‚Üí linked to "Retirement," "Tax Efficient Investing," etc.

**üìè Success Metrics**

**Metric** **Description**

**Ease of adding resources** Adding a new resource should take **<30 seconds**.

**Ease of finding resources** The tagging system should make it **easy to retrieve relevant materials** by topic.

**Accuracy of notes** Notes should provide **clear, actionable insights** when reviewing resources.

**Number of resources cataloged** Track progress on building the database.

**Percentage of tagged resources** Ensure at least **50% of resources are tagged** with key concepts.

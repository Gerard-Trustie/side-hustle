# Project Brief: UK Young Adult Side Hustle Directory

## 1. Core Problem

Young adults in the UK seeking side hustles face a fragmented and often unreliable information landscape. Existing resources (blogs, general directories, gig platforms) lack comprehensive coverage, specific tailoring to the UK young adult demographic, consistent reliability, and the intuitive user experience expected by digitally native users. There is no single, trusted, go-to platform that effectively aggregates, categorizes, and presents side hustle opportunities in a user-friendly, reliable, and comprehensive manner specifically for this audience.

## 2. Goals

- **Primary Goal:** Establish the platform as the UK's leading, most comprehensive, reliable, and user-friendly online directory of side hustles specifically for young adults (approx. 16-30).
- **User Goals:** Enable young adults to easily discover, evaluate, and connect with legitimate and relevant side hustle opportunities that match their skills, interests, location, and time availability.
- **Platform Goals:**
  - Build a high degree of user trust through accurate, verified information and transparency.
  - Achieve significant organic visibility and user adoption within the target demographic.
  - Foster a sense of community and peer-to-peer support (long-term).
  - Become a sustainable and valuable resource.

## 3. Target Audience

- **Primary:** UK residents aged approximately 16-30. This includes students (secondary, college, university), recent graduates, and those in early stages of their careers.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Digitally native, comfortable with modern web and mobile interfaces.
  - Seeking supplementary income, financial independence, ways to save, skill development, or avenues to explore entrepreneurial interests.
  - Value convenience, reliability, and peer validation (reviews, social proof).
  - May have varying levels of skills, experience, and time availability.
  - Motivated by factors ranging from necessity to passion projects.

## 4. Core Concept & Key Features (High-Level)

A mobile-first, online directory platform specifically curated for UK young adults, featuring:

- **Comprehensive Listings:** A wide range of legitimate side hustle opportunities relevant to the UK context (online, offline, skill-based, asset-based, task-based).
- **Intuitive Structure:** Organised using user-centric categories (Create & Sell, Offer Your Skills, Rent or Share Your Stuff, Help Out Locally, Do Quick Jobs Online, Be a Creator, Play with Tech & Trends).
- **Powerful Discovery:** Advanced search combined with granular filtering options (e.g., Location, Online/Offline, Skills Required, Potential Income, Time Commitment, Startup Cost, Platform Specific, Interests).
- **Detailed Information:** Rich listing pages with descriptions, potential earnings, requirements, pros/cons, platform links, and trust indicators.
- **Trust & Reliability Focus:** Commitment to data accuracy, verification processes, and transparency.
- **User Experience:** Clean, modern, fast, and mobile-optimised interface.
- **(Future) Community Hub:** Potential integration of user reviews, ratings, forums, and success stories.

## 5. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope

### **MVP - IN Scope:**

- **Core Directory:** Browseable/searchable listings within the defined category structure.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Implementation of key filters (Location, Online/Offline, Skills, Income Potential, Time Commitment, Startup Cost).
- **Detailed Listing Pages:** Essential information per hustle (Description, Earnings Estimate, Requirements, Links).
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design:** Functional and usable across desktop and mobile browsers.
- **User Accounts:** Basic functionality (registration, login, ability to save favourite listings).

### **MVP - OUT of Scope (Potential Future Phases):**

- **Community Features:** Forums, user profiles beyond basic accounts, user-submitted stories/guides.
- **User Submission of Listings:** Defer to ensure quality control initially.
- **Map Integration:** Useful for local tasks, but not essential for MVP launch.
- **Advanced Personalization:** Features beyond saving favorites (e.g., recommendation engine).
- **Native Mobile App:** Focus on responsive web app first.
- **Complex Monetization:** Focus on user value; defer ads, subscriptions, complex affiliate schemes.

## 6. Initial Technical Leanings (High-Level)

- **Platform:** Modern web framework focused on performance and scalability.
- **Database:** Structured to support efficient filtering, tagging, and future growth (user data, reviews).
- **Architecture:** Consider scalability from the start (e.g., potential for API, service-oriented approach long-term).
- **Hosting:** Reliable UK-based hosting solution.
- **Focus:** Prioritise security, performance (load times), and maintainability.
